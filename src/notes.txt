Class --> Class is a blueprint. It is a collection of variables and methods.
Variables --> Define the state
Method --> Define the behaviour

Any class which is not belongs to java.lang or same package then we have to import it explicitly.

constructor -- > force to provide information at the time of initalization of class.
this.name = name (this represents the current class)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

constructor & overloading constructor
method & overloading method
variables:
---------
Global variables --> Scoop of the variable is available throughout the class

1.) Instance variable(non static)
2.) Class variable (static variable)

static method or variable can called via class name
static variable can be constant by making final key and variables name should be upper case e.g. final static NUM_EYES = 2;

Local variables --> Scoop of the variable is limited to the method or constructor

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The this keyword :-
this is a keyword in Java which is used as a reference to the object of the current class, with in an instance method or a constructor.
Using this you can refer the members of a class such as constructors, variables and methods.

Note − The keyword this is used only within instance methods or constructors

This
In general, the keyword this is used to − Differentiate the instance variables from local variables if they have same names,
within a constructor or a method.
